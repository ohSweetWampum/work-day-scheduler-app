## Description

This program asks the user how long they want their password to be (min 8 - max 128) and if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters in their password. The user must select at least 1 character type (lowercase, uppercase, special character, number). They must answer either "yes" or "no" to all prompts about character type or 8-18 for the password length prompt, if they fail to do any if this, they will be sent to the beginning of the program to start over. A password is randomly generated based off the user criteria.

## Code Highlight

I wanted to highlight this code snippet because it took me forever to get right. I basically finished my entire code when I realized that I forgot that I needed to make sure that the user selects at least 1 character type. So this function starts the entire process in correct order, empties out the global array if the user is running the program after their first try. It uses a while loop to ensure that the user selects at least 1 character type before the program generates the password.
